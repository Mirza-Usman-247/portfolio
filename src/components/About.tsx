        I am a passionate front-end developer 💻 with a strong foundation in
        creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. Currently, I am
        expanding my skill set by learning Python 🐍 through the Governor Sindh
        IT Course (GIAIC) 📚, a program designed to empower individuals with
        cutting-edge IT skills. This step reflects my commitment to continuous
        growth 🚀 and my desire to explore more about web development, data
        analysis, and beyond. With a blend of creativity 🎨, technical expertise
        🔧, and a relentless drive to learn.
